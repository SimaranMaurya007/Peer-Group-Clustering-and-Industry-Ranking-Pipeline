# Comprehensive Machine Learning Pipeline for Peer-Group Clustering and Industry Ranking

This repository contains an implementation of a complete machine learning pipeline designed to:
- **Peer-Group Clustering:** Identify natural groupings among entities using multiple clustering algorithms.
- **Industry Ranking:** Compute a composite industry score and optionally train a supervised ranker to predict industry performance.
- **Cross-Modal Fusion:** Combine structured numerical and categorical data with unstructured text data using embeddings or a TF-IDF fallback.

The notebook provides a reproducible, modular workflow for data segmentation, industry ranking, and integration of multimodal data sources.

## Overview

Many real-world problems require:
1. Grouping similar entities, such as companies or products, to form meaningful peer groups.
2. Ranking those groups or industries using a transparent, reproducible scoring system.
3. Integrating both structured (numerical, categorical) and unstructured (text) data into a single pipeline.

This notebook addresses all three objectives, offering a clear and repeatable process for clustering, ranking, and analyzing data.

## Features

- **Multiple Clustering Algorithms:** Includes K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, with the ability to compare performance across methods.
- **Dynamic Feature Engineering:** Automatically handles numeric, categorical, and text features with scaling, encoding, and embedding generation.
- **Industry Ranking:** Generates composite scores and provides an option to train a supervised learning-to-rank model.
- **Cross-Modal Fusion:** Uses state-of-the-art text embeddings (or TF-IDF fallback) to merge textual data with numerical features.
- **Visualization:** Produces plots, tables, and summary statistics to evaluate clustering quality and ranking outcomes.
- **Modularity:** Each stage of the pipeline can be customized or replaced with alternative methods.

## Pipeline Structure

1. Data Preparation
   ├─ Import raw data
   ├─ Handle missing values
   └─ Encode categorical features

2. Feature Engineering
   ├─ Scale and normalize numerical features
   ├─ Generate embeddings for text data
   └─ Apply optional dimensionality reduction

3. Clustering
   ├─ Apply K-Means, Agglomerative, or DBSCAN clustering
   ├─ Evaluate using cluster quality metrics
   └─ Assign cluster labels

4. Industry Ranking
   ├─ Compute composite ranking scores
   └─ Optionally train a supervised ranker (LightGBM / XGBoost)

5. Cross-Modal Fusion
   ├─ Combine numeric and text features
   └─ Build final unified feature representation

6. Results and Visualization
   ├─ Export labeled dataset
